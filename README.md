# CMPSC-497_Final_Project

The project was ran on Google Colab Pro on L4 GPU with 22.5GB RAM. 

The notebook `Final_Data_Collection` contains code used to convert raw data to the final dataset.

The `final_raw_dataset.csv` file is the output of the above notebook. However, due to GitHub size constraints, maybe truncated.

The notebook `BART_fine_tuning` contains all of the code used for fine-tuning the BART Open-Source LLM and evaluating it with different evaluation metrics.
